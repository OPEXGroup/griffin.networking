Griffin.Networking
==================

High performance networking library for .NET.

First public beta has been release (nuget package).

Read about the framework [here](http://blog.gauffin.org/2012/05/griffin-networking-a-somewhat-performant-networking-library-for-net/)

Still work in progress but the core framework should be reasonable stable.
